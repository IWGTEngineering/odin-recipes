    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This is the opening descriptive paragraph about pork steaks with white wine & mushroom sauce. A childhood favourite of mine, its ingredients are cheap to source yet result in a delicious dish.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Pork Chops</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2lb. sliced mushrooms, crimini or baby portobello</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 large shallot, minced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>Salt, pepper, minced parsley</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat the pork chops dry with a paper towel and season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Add the olive oil to a skillet and when it is hot, add the pork chops and let them brown for a couple of minutes on each side.
        </li>
        <li>Remove after they start to turn brown.
        </li>
        <li>Do not cook them all the way through.
        </li>
        <li>Add the butter to the skillet, then the sliced mushrooms.
        </li>
        <li>When the mushrooms start to become a little limp, add the shallots and garlic, season with salt and pepper, and cook until transparent.
        </li>
        <li>Put the pork chops back into the skillet with the mushrooms then pour in the wine and chicken stock.
        </li>
        <li>Lower the heat to a slow simmer and cook just until the pork chops are cooked through. It should take no more than five minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Mix the cornstarch with a little water or chicken broth and add to the pan a little at a time, until the sauce starts to thicken.
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle with parsley and serve with rice or noodles or mashed potatoes.
        </li>
    </ol>
